# The Tale Behind Froggy's Adventure üìñ

## The Game's Odyssey

Once upon a time, in a world where floppy disks reigned and the internet was a mere fledgling, a young dreamer (yours truly at 15) conjured up a magical world in the form of a game. This world was home to a plucky little frog named Froggy. Crafted with love, pixels, and lines of C++ and Assembly, this game was a treasure.

But alas, tragedy struck! A brotherly squabble led to the erasure of this digital realm. Froggy and his world vanished into the ether, living on only in memories... until now.

25 years later, armed with Python and an AI sidekick (hello, ChatGPT!), the dream was rekindled. Piece by piece, line by line, Froggy's world was reborn. This game is not just a collection of code; it's a phoenix rising from the ashes of 3 1/4 inch floppy disks. Welcome to a journey of nostalgia, re-creation, and froggy fun!

## Froggy's Story: The Unkissable Prince

In a far-off magical land, there lived a prince with sky-blue robes and a charming smile. But fate, with its twisted sense of humor, had other plans for our regal friend. A mischievous wizard, offended by the prince's refusal to trade his kingdom's secret treasure, cast a dastardly spell. In a flash of green light, the prince was transformed into a frog!

Thus began the life of Froggy, the once-prince, now an amphibian with a crown. The wizard's spell came with a cruel twist: Froggy was doomed to remain a frog as there was no princess to kiss him (apparently, princesses have standards too). His only hope lay in a legend ‚Äì a series of mystical potions scattered across the land, hidden in the most perplexing of mazes.

But Froggy was no ordinary frog. With a heart of a prince and the hops of a champion, he decided to take fate into his own webbed feet. "If no princess will kiss me, I shall reclaim my princely form myself!" he croaked determinedly.

Join Froggy in his whimsical quest across tricky terrains, through doors of mystery, and around deceptive rocks. Each potion brings him a leap closer to breaking the spell.

# The Rules of the Game üåüüéÆ

## The Quest of the Unkissable Prince

Welcome, brave adventurer, to the enchanting and slightly quirky world of Froggy's Adventure! As you guide Froggy through his quest to regain his princely form, here are the mystical rules that govern his world:

### The Objective

- **The Potion Predicament**: In each level, scattered across the maze are bottles filled with a magical potion. Froggy's mission? To hop around and drink all these potions.
- **Unlocking the Door to Destiny**: Each potion Froggy drinks brings him closer to his goal. Once every bottle on a level is emptied, the mystical door to the next level swings open, beckoning Froggy forward on his quest.

### The Challenge

- **The Twist of the Potion**: Ah, but it's not all hop and drink in Froggy's world. Each potion, once consumed, turns into an impassable obstacle. Strategy is key, as Froggy must plan his route wisely. One wrong hop, and he might find himself boxed in, unable to reach the remaining potions!
- **Navigating the Maze**: Besides the potion-turned-obstacles, Froggy must deftly navigate around rocks and other barriers that litter the landscape of each level. It's a puzzle that requires foresight and a bit of trial and error.

### Your Role

- As the guiding spirit of Froggy, use the arrow keys to move him in the desired direction.
- Plan Froggy's path to ensure all potions are consumed without trapping him.
- Reach the door to progress to the next level and continue the quest for Froggy's true form.

## The Adventure Awaits!

Each level is a unique puzzle, a new challenge in Froggy's journey. Can you help our Unkissable Prince overcome the odds, outsmart the wizard's spell, and hop his way back to royalty? Grab your keyboard, and let the adventure begin!
